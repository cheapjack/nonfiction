            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="lead">
	<p><strong>Domestic Science</strong> was setup by artists <a href="#">Glenn Boulter</a>, <a href="#">Ross Dalziel</a> and <a href="#">Hwa Young Jung</a> to explore a playful notion of what the Domestic could be. Our key approach is to not use science and technology as a subject for our practice but rather explore it as a <strong>culture</strong>. 

<!--<br>We are interested in what skills and common knowledge can be constituted as <strong>domestic science</strong> today. In the 1970's this may have been how to cook well with some gender role assumptions included. In the 21st Century this could mean internet security and digital identity, how to play minecraft, understand economic growth, historic water levels or monitor air quality for dangers of fracking.-->

<p>Our methodology is building relationships with people as co-researchers. We have a life-long learning attitude towards education, and attempt to bring in critical thinking to technology, science and arts cultures. We see facilitation as a core creative part of our artistic practice and consider participants as fellow researchers.</p>

	<h3>Research</h3>
		<p>All of our research involves collaborative work and prototyping to make things like <a href="http://github.com/cefn/avatap">Avatap</a> which we made with <a href="http://start.shrimping.it/">Shrimping.It</a> and <a href="http://github.com/cheapjack/RF-Craft">RF-Craft</a> which we then use to engage with the public. We also try to be critical in the way we build and use such tools and make sure they consider the technical and social contexts in which they are developed and where they are used and with whom. This kind of thinking led to the <a href="http://criticalkits.re-dock.org/">Critical-kits Symposium</a> we worked on with <a href="http://re-dock.org/">Re-Dock</a>
		<p>We are currently running research workshops and hackdays where we experiment and develop tools so everyone can have non-fiction adventures. You can play an <a target="_blank" href="http://domesticscience.org.uk/Non-FictionPreHack.html">adventure about our last workshop/pre-hack here</a>. Tweet us <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/DomesticaSci">@DomesticaSci</a> if you want to get involved and watch things like the <a target="_blank" href="http://doesliverpool.com">DoESLiverpool</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/DoES-Liverpool">Google Group</a> for further events!</p>-->
